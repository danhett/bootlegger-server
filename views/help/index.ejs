      <h3>What is Bootlegger?</h3>
      <p>Bootlegger is an integrated solution for helping people make videos together using mobile devices.</p>
      <h3>How does it work?</h3>

      <h3>How many people can share a Bootlegger event?</h3>
      <p>As many as you like! The only limit to the size of Bootlegger projects is your imagination.</p>
      <h3>Does Bootlegger share my details with anyone?</h3>
      <p>Not without your permission. At every event you can choose how your footage is shared with organisers and crew.</p>
      <h3>What can I do with Bootlegger videos once they're uploaded?</h3>
      <p>Bootlegger’s <strong>watch</strong> page lets you make basic edits of footage from your event. Alternatively, you can load your footage into editing software such as Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere and let Bootlegger’s <strong>EDL exporter </strong> take the work out of logging clips.</p>
      <h3>Does bootlegger need a good 3G/4G signal?</h3>
      <p>Bootlegger <strong>live music events</strong> need a 3G or 4G connection to support real-time coordination between partcipants. All other bootlegger events can run without 3G after you’ve initially joined the film crew for an event.</p>
      <h3>How big are Bootlegger video files?</h3>
      <p>Bootlegger uses your mobile device’s camera at the best settings it can find, so file size can vary. When using Bootlegger it’s a good idea to make sure you have plenty of free space on your mobile device and only upload footage over WiFi.</p>
      <h3>Can I get bootlegger for Apple and Windows phones?</h3>
      <p>Not yet but we’re working on it!</p>
